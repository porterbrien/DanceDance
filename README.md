# Overview

Something that I wanted to attempt was to see if I could make a mobile game that is similar to Dance Dance revolution. I wanted to see if I could produce something similar, I want this to be a long project where I can make my own music and then import it into this file. For right now, this is the minium viable product until I can create and import my own songs that I am making. 

The application is a game, when the directions come down from the top of the screen, the user must prepare to hit the correct keys to earn points.

It is built to entertain the user. It was also built to entertain me and to make a continuous project that I can keep adding to at my leasure.

# Development Environment

I used Vs code as my text editor. And the source documentation of Typescript and React

I used React and Typescript which should go well with android applications.

# Future Work

* Item 1: Make the game 'beat' sensitive. When music is playing the tiles should be pressed by the user so that it matches the beat of the music.
* Item 2: Make the design cleaner for the user. I want to make art for the background.
* Item 3: Menu, make a home screen for the user.
* Item 4: I put some code in that should help me put in lives for the user
* Item 5: I want to make levels, some harder than others
* Item 3: I want to add combos, so the user gets extra points the better they are doing
* Item 3: I want to make a Timer so it shows how much time you have left for the level
